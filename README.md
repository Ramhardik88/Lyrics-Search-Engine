# Lyrics API

---


## Description

<p>Remember when music tracks used to have lyrics and we used to search for them? Let's build an interface for that! We will build our own "search engine" dedicated only to lyrics.</p>

<p>In the <b>Lyrics API Challenge</b> we will use jQuery and its $.AJAX method for communicating with the API, work on separation of concerns, making our code more clean and animate some UI elements according to the application's state.</p>


### Tech stack
